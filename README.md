# BORC
Battery-Operated Radiator Control

A low-power automatic radiator control that is designed to retrofit on steam radiators that use Honeywell's T104A1040 Zone Valve Operator
uses LowPowerLab's [DualOptiboot](https://github.com/LowPowerLab/DualOptiboot) bootloader for the ATmega1284P.

This repo contains:
- PCB design files and schematic for control board, power board and LED board for the BORC.
- Firmware for a low-power radiator control node
